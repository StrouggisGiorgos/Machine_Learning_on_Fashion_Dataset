# Overview
For these exercises we use JuPyter Notebook and PyTorch for various Machine Learning applications.
In 'MachineLearningTorchEdition' we utilize several different classifiers for the data in our .csv file which consists of 'images' from the Fashion MNIST Dataset, including:
* Max-pooling and Array
* Nearest Neighbor Classifier
* Decision Tree and Random Forest
* Linear SVM Classifier
* SVM with RBF kernel
* Feed Forward Neural Network
* Convolutional Neural Network
In 'MachineLearning2' we utilize dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA or Autoencoder.
More information is present in the appropriately named .pdf files for each one.
